This project implements the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) from scratch using real market data from Yahoo Finance. It estimates a stock’s systematic risk (β), expected return, and analyzes the distribution of returns using probabilistic modeling.

The project is designed to reflect how quantitative finance teams analyze equity risk and market exposure.
